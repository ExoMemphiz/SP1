## Hand-in
You can either hand in via mail or by showing your solution to the instructors.

If you hand in via mail, you can get the additional "attendance points" if your score is THREE or above
and you have completed either 4 or 5. The mail should be sent to ``iwantstudypoints@gmail.com``, have a
topic called `Study point exercises 1`` and _must_ include either a link to a git repository (GitHub,
Bitbucket or whatever) containing all the code for the exercises.
Please make sure that we can access the repository before you hand it in.
